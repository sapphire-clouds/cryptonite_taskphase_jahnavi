# File Globbing

**Objective:** Learn how to use globbing to simplify file path referencing in the shell by automatically matching filenames and patterns.

## Matching with `*`

**Command used:** `*`

- The `*` wildcard matches any files in the current directory.
- Makes it easier to work with multiple files at once.

**Learned:** The `*` matches any part of the filename except for `/` or a leading `.` character.

## Matching with `?`

**Command used:** `?`

- The `?` wildcard matches any single character in a file name.
- Works like `*`, but only replaces one character.

## Matching with `[]`

**Command used:** `[]`

- The `[]` wildcard matches a specific subset of characters within the brackets.
- It allows you to specify which characters to match instead of matching any single character.

**Learned:** The `[]` wildcard can match specified characters instead of just one character.

## Exclusionary Globbing

**Learned:**  If the first character in the brackets is a `!` or (in newer versions of bash) a `^`, the glob inverts, and that bracket instance matches characters that aren't listed.
